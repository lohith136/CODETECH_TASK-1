Project Overview:                                                                                                        
Objective:

To explore how different housing and demographic factors (such as the number of rooms, the socio-economic status of the population, and the quality of education) influence the median home value.

Data Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution and correlation of features with the target variable, MEDV.
Correlation Analysis: Assess the linear relationships between RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO, and MEDV.
Predictive Modeling: Develop a predictive model using these features to estimate MEDV.

Insights:

Rooms and Value: A higher average number of rooms (RM) tends to increase the median home value.
Socio-Economic Status: A higher percentage of lower-status population (LSTAT) correlates with lower median home values.
Education: The pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO) might indicate the quality of education in the area, affecting home values.

Conclusion:

The analysis aims to identify significant factors that influence home prices, helping potential homeowners and real estate investors make informed decisions.
